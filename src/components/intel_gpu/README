Intel GPU Component: (intel_gpu)
Support Intel Graphics Performance metrics

====================

General Information
-----------------------
PAPI "intel_gpu" component is for accessing Intel Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) hardware performance metrics through Intel oneAPI Level0 Interface.


Code layout
------------------
The codes are in components/intel_gpu:
intel_gpu/linux_intel_gpu_metrics.c:    implement PAPI component vector functions.
intel_gpu/internal/src:                 source codes for accessing Intel GPU metrics using oneAPI Level0 API
intel_gpu/internal/inc:                 header files and data structure needed for presenting metric data
intel_gpu/tests:                        test cases
   gpu_metric_list.c                    list available metrics
   gpu_metric_read.c                    get metric data through time based sampling. Use METRICS_SAMPLING_PERIOD environment to change the sampling period.
   gpu_thread_read.c                    multi-thrad read metric data through time based sampling.
   gpu_query_gemm.cc                     get metric data for an offload kernel (gemm).
                                        Do time based metrics sampling if only set "ZE_ENABLE_METRICS=1"
                                        Do query metrics on kernel if set both "ZE_ENABLE_METRICS=1" and "ZE_ENABLE_API_TRACING=1"

Build component
-----------------
./configure --with-components="intel_gpu"
Need to build in a machine with oneAPI Level0 header files
The directory of Level0 header files can be defined using INTEL_L0_HEADERS
Default installation location is /usr/include/level_zero/


System dependency to run 
-------------------------
(1) Have oneAPI Level0 installed  libze_loader.so in the lib path
(2) Have Intel graphics driver installed, software library libmd.so is in the lib path. 
(3) /proc/sys/dev/i915/perf_stream_paranoid is set to "0"
(4) User needs to be added into render/video group
(5) set environment varaibale ZET_ENABLE_METRICS=1  (enable metrics).
(6) [option]  set environement variable ZET_ENABLE_API_TRACING_EXP=1 to enable metric query mode.

Runtime environment:
(1) Enable metrics. This must be set.
    ZET_ENABLE_METRICS=1
(2) Change the sampling period,  default is 400000
    METRICS_SAMPLING_PERIOD=<value>
(3) Enable metrics query on an kernel
    ZET_ENABLE_API_TRACING_EXP=1


Note:
There are two collection modes supported.
(1) Time based sampling.
(2) Metrics query on a kernel. In this mode,  the PAPI_start() and PAPI_stop must be called before kernel launch and after kernel execution completes. When setting ZE_ENABLE_API_TRACTING=1,  the collection will switch to metrics query mode.
