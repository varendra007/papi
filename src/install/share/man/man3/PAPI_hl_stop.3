\fBPAPI_hl_stop\fP stops a running high-level event set\&.
.PP
This call is optional and only necessary if the programmer wants to use the low-level API in addition to the high-level API\&. It should be noted that \fBPAPI_hl_stop\fP and low-level calls are not allowed inside of a marked region\&. Furthermore, \fBPAPI_hl_stop\fP is thread-local and therefore has to be called in the same thread as the corresponding marked region\&.
